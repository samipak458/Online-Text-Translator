# Online AI Text Translator

The Online AI Text Translator project is an application that uses **Python Flask and Azure Cognitive Services (Translator)** to provide a user-friendly interface for translating text between multiple languages. This application is built using Flask, a popular Python web framework, and Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services, a suite of machine learning-based tools that enable developers to add intelligence to applications. Website is deployed using **Azure App Service**, you can see step by step guidlines on hosting website on [Azure App Service](https://github.com/samipak458/Online-AI-Text-Translator/blob/main/Azure%20App%20Service.md) .

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a web application that can translate text in real-time and with high accuracy. The user can input text in one language, and the application will automatically detect the language and translate the text into the user's desired language.

##  Architecture
The application's architecture consists of two primary components: the front-end user interface and the back-end server. The front-end user interface is created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The user interface allows the user to input text to be translated and select the desired output language. The back-end server is built using **Python Flask**, which handles the translation process and communication with **Azure Cognitive Services**.

To use Azure Cognitive Services, you need to create a Cognitive Services account, configure the API key, and set up the Flask application to communicate with the Translation API. Once the server is configured, the application can start accepting translation requests from the user and return the translated text to the user interface.

## Benefit
The Online AI Text Translator project is a useful tool for anyone who needs to communicate in different languages and can be deployed as a web application accessible from any device with internet access. This application can also be extended to support additional features such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.
